// H22 — in-flight dispatch register (decision ec9eacaa, boards 54c451b4 /
// 570832d4). ONE hook file registered on BOTH SubagentStart and SubagentStop,
// switching on stdin.hook_event_name: Start appends {agent_id, agent_type,
// session_id, files, at} to .sterling/transient/dispatch-register.json, Stop
// removes the entry whose agent_id matches — EXCEPT for a reviewer-class
// entry (agent_type starting with the literal prefix 'reviewer-'), which is
// first PROMOTED as {agent_type, files, at} into the durable review ledger
// at .sterling/review-ledger.json (STORE ROOT, not transient/, so it
// survives H1's session wipe — decision 12a26ca6-a301-466d-a45c-5e1eeff36694,
// slug review-receipt-ledger) and then removed from the register exactly as
// before. The register is what makes live fan-out a DISCLOSED FACT rather
// than conductor memory — H10 reads it at Stop and defers file duties owned
// by a live dispatch, instead of reading an agent's work-in-progress as
// conductor negligence (570832d4: the same capture_pending minted three
// times in one hour).
//
// LIVE-PROBED, not inferred: SubagentStart (research_finding 35a89a0f, CC
// 2.1.220) and SubagentStop (research_finding 20b44518, CC 2.1.237 — fires for
// background agents; agent_id is byte-stable across start→stop). NEITHER event
// carries a prompt field, so `files` is recovered from the PARENT transcript at
// transcript_path via the shared lib/dispatch-prompt.mjs extractor — the union
// across a message's parallel dispatch blocks is an accepted, disclosed
// imprecision (it can over-attribute a sibling's files, which over-defers; the
// staleness TTL in H10 bounds that).
//
// NEVER A GATE (h19-dispatch-staging posture): this hook must never deny a
// spawn or a stop. Internal failure is loud but non-blocking (warnNonBlocking,
// exit 1); a corrupt register on disk degrades to empty and is rewritten valid.
//
// CONCURRENCY, stated honestly — REGISTER vs LEDGER are NOT the same case.
// The register's write is ATOMIC (tmp file + rename), so a concurrent READER
// — H10 at Stop, a sibling fire — never sees a torn file: a torn read
// degrades the WHOLE register to empty, which would drop every live entry at
// exactly the moment fan-out traffic makes that most likely. The register's
// read-modify-write LOST UPDATE is NOT solved and is accepted: two fires
// overlapping between read and rename means the loser's change vanishes. It
// cuts BOTH ways — a lost Start under-defers (a duty fires that could have
// waited), and a Start that re-writes an entry a concurrent Stop had just
// removed OVER-defers (a duty waits that was already owed). Both are bounded,
// never permanent: H10's staleness TTL stops honoring an orphan entry, and H1
// deletes the register outright at the next session start.
//
// THE DURABLE REVIEW LEDGER IS THE OPPOSITE CASE — the register's acceptance
// above does NOT transfer to it. The ledger has no TTL and H1 never wipes it
// (that survival is the whole point), so a lost update there is bounded by
// NOTHING: it is a permanent loss of reviewer evidence that
// scripts/commit-reviewed.mjs can never recover. That asymmetry is exactly
// why the ledger's read-modify-write (here, and in commit-reviewed's consume
// step) is LOCK-GUARDED (withLedgerLock below) — the register's
// "accept the lost update" posture would be the wrong call applied to a file
// with no self-healing mechanism.
